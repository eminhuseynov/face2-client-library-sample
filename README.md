# face2-client-library-sample
A sample JS and PHP based library to detect and crop user face using a webcam or mobile phone camera.
At completion it creates a PNG image (base64 encoded data) ready to be sent to FACE2 API.
Uses a couple of JS scripts to detect face at client side and crop using PHP. Copyrights of used libraries can be found in JS file headers.


* P.S. the code is a complete mess, grateful if anybody wants to clean it up or even optimize
